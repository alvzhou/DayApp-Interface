# DayApp Planner Interface 

## Introduction 


With everyone at full swing with their busy schedules throughout the school year, it has become more difficult
than ever to keep track of not only tasks, but to also find time to yourself. 
With the help of this Day Interface, not only will it display tasks as an easy reminder, but this application will 
also perform the following:

- Display a Menu **interface** with ability to choose options from submenus (Tasks, Clothing, Outfits)
- Personalized **to-do lists menu** 
  - Ability to add, remove, print, and list tasks
- Planned **meals** (instead of figuring out on the spot what and when to eat)
  - Add or Remove Meals
- Display **outfit/clothing** for the day
  - Add or Remove Outfits
- Reset Day (Clear all items for the day in preparation for the next day)

Anyone who faces difficulty with time management will find this interface super useful and likely see a noticeably 
improvement 
to their lifestyle. In fact, this will help save large amounts of time for the next day, having planned it earlier. 
This project is of interest to me not only because of its practicality, but also the fact that it provides a method of
automation, an integral
part of software construction that I am passionate about.
